#=================   change.log    =================#


0.2.1: First release
0.3.7:

  1) Fix to legendary versions – scopes which already had their legendary version, now are correctly based on it – applies to SO-21 Saika, Jue, Handyman, Kanetsugu, HPO Kanone MAX Mk.77, and Gaki. It fixes e.g. Scopes that Scope settings for legendary versions

  2) 'Removed' non-existing variants, which I accidently added: both of Handyman military and pimp versions – they still exist, so no one finds their weapon disappeared, but are labelled as mistake and cannot be crafted or equipped – disassemble them at once!

  3) Added new variants!
   – Add-Vantage: Frank
   – HPO Kanone MAX Mk.77: Panam, Buck, Breakthrough and Reed
