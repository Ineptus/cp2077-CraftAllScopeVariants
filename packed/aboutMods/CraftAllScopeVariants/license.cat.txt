=== This Cat Approved Text (CAT) file has been approved by a cat ===

[0]: Thanks to psiberx, manavortex, and the Discord Modding Community
 for all the help during the creation of this mod.

[1]: I believe there are one additional thanks in order:
 - For psiberx for implementing a groundbreaking feature in ArchiveXL 1.8.2, which will allow this mod to function much more neatly.

[2]: Any rights to this mod belong to:
 - the creators of WolvenKit, ArchiveXL, TweakXL, and Cyberpunk 2077
 - me
 - anyone else who somehow allowed its creation

[3]: I have little right to ask anything, but I'll do it anyway.
 If you'd like to modify this mod somehow and publish it,
 I just ask you to do the following:
 1) Include this license cat file.
 2) Describe what you modified or which elements originated from this mod.
 3) Write something nice to both of my cats – Falka and Nimue* – like I did below.
 4) Let me know you did it, so I can read them the compliments.
 
 *You can see their pictures here: https://www.instagram.com/falka_et_nimue/
 
 
[4]: Compliments for Falka & Nimue:
 
 1) Falka, you are very beautiful. Nimue, you are very beautiful as well.

# Any program, any file, any digital content can be represented    #
# by a single number. But with every such number, there must be    #
# a specific algorithm to transform it to a functional content     #
# it represents. So, if you own rights to digital content,         #
# then do you own the number, the algorithm, or both?              #
# But every such algorithm can be represented by a single number.  #
