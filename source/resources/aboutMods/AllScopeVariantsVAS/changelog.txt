#=================   change.log    =================#

0.5.0 – VAS 1.0

  Released as a submod of CraftAllScopeVariants

0.5.1 Moved localization from /base/ to /CraftAllScopeVariants/ to avoid conflicts.

0.5.2 Added a grey version of Jue as requested by cielle. It's almost Christmas, couldn't help myself.
  
0.6.0

  1) Hotfix for 2.1 – had to (probably temporary) bring back .app substitutors and revert to using visualTags, because of a change in ArchiveXL, which was causing glitches like nontranslucent E255 Percipient, darker Handyman or missing ammo counter in ClearVue.

  2) Added rare variants for ClearVue Mk.8, Kairo SA-1, Hyakume, and CQO Kanone MINI Mk.72 – I somehow forgot about them and made rare variants only for scopes which had common and uncommon variants as well.
  
  3) Sometime during last updates I added my long scopes to be used in handguns and long+short to be used in sniper rifles. I'm leaving it this way, you can always change this yourself in /r6/tweaks/PossibleScopesListsPopulator.yaml
